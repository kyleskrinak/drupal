# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the official Docker image for [drupal](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/drupal/). See the
Hub page for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information
regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs),
specificially in [docker-library/docs/drupal](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/drupal).

I forked the official drupal docker repo so as to expose the drupal html mount point via kitematic.
